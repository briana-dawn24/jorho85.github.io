					<h1>Getting and explaing data</h1>
					<h2>from Studies or Experiments</h2>
					<p>
						Last time, we learned some data basics with a focus on data tables, which neatly organize data into rows of observations and columns of variables.
						Today, we'll take a <span class='it'>brief</span> look tpyes of studies and describing data numerically and graphically.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is all based on chapters 2 and 3 in the book.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Observational studies vs controlled experiments</h2>
						<p>There are two main techniques to systematically collect data:</p>
						<ul>
						   <li>Observational studies and</li>
						   <li>Controlled experiments</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Observational studies</h3>
						<p>An <em>observational study</em> is one where the data collection does not interfere with how the data arises. Examples include</p>
						<ul>
						   <li>Surveys,</li>
						   <li>Review of records,</li>
						   <li>Simple measurements</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Controlled experiments</h3>
						<p>
							In an <em>experiment</em>, researchers actively work with the samples applying treatments and observing effects.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Often (if not always), the intention is to explore a relationship or even a causal effect between two variable.
							</li>
							<li>
								For that reason, it's often important to distinguish between an <em>explanatory variable</em> and a <em>response variable</em>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>An observational example</h2>
						<p>
							Suppose we are interested in the following question:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							Does caffeine consumed through coffee affect GPA among CCCTI students?
						</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The observational approach</h3>
						<p>
							To perform an observational study, we might select 24 CCCTI students and interview them. We might ask a number of questions but two questions key to the study would be:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>How much caffeinated coffee do you drink (in cups)?</li>
							<li>What is your GPA?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The resulting data</h3>
						<p>
							If we interview 14 of the 3876 students at CCCTI, we might generate a table that looks something like so:
						</p>
						<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

						<h3>Visualization</h3>
						<p>We might visualize the data with a <span class="it">scatter plot</span>.</p>
						<div style="text-align: center">
							<img src="image1.png" alt=""  width="700" height="500">
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Analysis</h3>
						<p>
							The numbers and picture kinda <span class="it">appear</span> to support the idea that caffeinated coffee consumption improves GPA.
							Of course, we ultimately hope to be able to quantify that type of analysis more precisely.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Sample/population for the coffee example</h3>
						<p>
							In the coffee example (where we interviewed 14 of the 3876 students at CCCTI),
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The <em>sample</em> is the 14 students we interviewed.
							</li>
							<li>
								The <em>population</em> is the set of all 3876 CCCTI students. <br />
								<span class="it">(The extent to which the conclusion might extend to all college students anywhere might be a point of discussion and further research.)</span>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Statistic/parameter for the coffee example</h3>
						<p>
							Suppose we find that, of the 14 students in our sample, the students drink 2.57 cups of coffee a day on average.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								That average number 2.57 computed from the sample is a <em>statistic</em>.
							</li>
							<li>
								If we could somehow determine the average number of cups of coffee consumed by <em>all</em> 3876 CCCTI students, that number would be a <em>parameter</em>.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Typically, it's not necessarily feasible to compute a parameter from an entire population. Thus, we <em>estimate</em> population parameters from sample statistics. A key question is:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							How close can we expect a computed statistic to be to the corresponding population parameter?
						</blockquote>

						<h2>Some important issues</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Confounding variables</li>
							<li>Causation vs correlation</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Confounding variables</h3>
						<p>
							A <em>confounding variable</em> is a variable (often unknown) that influences two or more other variables and causes a spurious association.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the coffee GPA example, a confounding variable might be the amount of time the student studies. If they study a lot, the might find themselves drinking more coffee <em>and</em> increase their GPA.
						</p>
						<p>
							The term <em>lurking variable</em> is a synonym for confounding variable.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Causation vs correlation</h3>
						<p>
							In statistics, we are often interested in the effect of one variable on another. In the context of the coffee study - does the consumption of caffeinated coffee improve GPA?
						</p>
						<p>
							Due to the potential presence of unknown confounding variables, whether there is a relationship between two variables - and <em>not</em> whether there is a causal relationship.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is sometimes phrased as
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							correlation does not imply causation.
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							To establish a causal relationship, you've really got to set up and experiment.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>An experimental example</h2>
						<p>
							In an experiment (more specifically, a <em>controlled experiment</em>), researchers actively work with the samples applying treatments and controls and observing effects.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let's outline an experimental approach to our another GPA question:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							Does 8 or more hours of sleep each night affect GPA among college students?
						</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The experimental approach</h3>
						<p>
							To explore this question via a controlled experiment, we would start with a large, simple random sample of participating college students. We would <em>randomly</em>
							assign the each student into one of two groups:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The treatment group, who would be required get 8 or more hours of sleep each night and</li>
							<li>the control group, who would get less than 8 or at least they are not required to get 8 hours.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							After some pre-specified amount of time, we would check and compare the grades earned by the two groups.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>
							If there were 250 participants in our sample, perhaps our results might look something like so:
						</p>
						<table class="centered" style="width: 250px">
							<tr>
								<th></th><th>Treatment</th> <th>Control</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>N</th><td>119</td><td>131</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>GPA</th><td>3.7</td><td>2.9</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<p>
							This looks like it might be compelling evidence that 8 hours of sleep boosts GPA. We would ultimately like to be able to quantify that statement.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Some key principles of experiments</h3>
						<ul>
						   <li>
						      <strong>Control</strong>: We split the group of patients into two groups:
						      <ul>
						         <li>A treatment group that receives the treatment</li>
						         <li>A control group that receives a placebo or is allowed to act normally.</li>
						      </ul>
						   </li>
						   <li><strong>Randomization</strong>: The groups should be chosen <em>randomly</em> to prevent bias and to even out confounding factors.</li>
						   <li><strong>Replication</strong>: The results should be reproducible</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If we find differences between the groups we can examine whether they are <em>statistically significant</em> or not.
							In fact, we are going to use this data to explore the ideas of Chapters 2 and 3 by taking a
							look at this <a href="https://marksmath.org/classes/Spring2022Stat185/tools/basic_data_explorer.html">data exploring web app</a></p>
